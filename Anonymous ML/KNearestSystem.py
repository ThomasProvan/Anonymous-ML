ML System
    Helper Object for the protocol
    Provides access to the ML backend.
    One per ML System
    Minimal Parameters - We'll be pre-setting or auto-calculating parameters
    Basic functions:
        Train - Input: Data. No output. Parameters set by the helper. 
        Test - Input: Data. Output: Varies by system.
        
    Questions
        How simple do we want this to be? Could combine the comparator into
        this, but since the comparator is our ultimate output, we probably
        want it to be as consistent as possible.

Okay, let's examine a question. Does this need to be a class?
Probably not, but my OO inclinations tell me to make it one XD

Let's see... oh, okay, I have an okay reason to do it this way.

We're going to be training 2 different machines with each type.
Comparing them is going to be relevant, so having a system object
for each run seems reasonable. We can then use other functions to
compare the two.

Hrm... Cross-fold. Where do / How do / Do we want to handle cross-fold?
We haven't answered that question quite yet. See TestController for more rambling
--- sk-learn has some cross-fold functions. Still need to hash out specifics

Secondary question: Do we want to have a MLSystem superclass?

I'm not sure. Just might not be relevant to make a superclass. It would be an
organizational tool, not a computational one. It would be useful in C++, in
Python I don't think it matters at all. There's no functions that I would want
to define at the level above this. Yay for weak typing?

On a completely unrelated note, weak typing makes me nervous sometimes XD

KNN specific notes.

Here's some example code for running unsupervised KNN from scikit-learn

>>> from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
>>> import numpy as np
>>> X = np.array([[-1, -1], [-2, -1], [-3, -2], [1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 2]])
>>> nbrs = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=2, algorithm='ball_tree').fit(X)
>>> distances, indices = nbrs.kneighbors(X)
>>> indices                                           
array([[0, 1],
       [1, 0],
       [2, 1],
       [3, 4],
       [4, 3],
       [5, 4]]...)
