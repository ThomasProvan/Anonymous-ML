Install Requirements

scapy (packet reading from file, could also use for sniffing later)

scikit-learn (machine learning algs)

I'm using Anaconda, along with the attached Spyder IDE. The Spyder project file is on github.
	For Anaconda, scikit-learn is installed with the Conda package manager, which handles the requirements. scapy can be installed with pip, though it requires some non-python libraries to run which need to be installed seperately.
	
TODO: Get the Anaconda Env into the repo.
